                            <h1>Thai Hom Mali rice favourite for Hong Kong foodies</h1>							
							<div class="subhead">Long grain variety a hit in the city for its aroma and softness.</div>
							</a>
                            </div>
							<hr>
							
                            <p>&quot;Hong Kong  people love to eat and they choose the best quality of food," says Mr Kenneth  Chan, Executive Director of Hong Kong rice importing company Kui Fat Yuen and  Chairman of the Rice Merchants Association of Hong Kong.&nbsp;"Rice is no  exception.&nbsp;Thai Hom Mali rice has the highest quality among all the Thai  rice.&quot; </p>
                            <p>A specialist in trading in Thai Hom Mali rice, Kui Fat Yuen was started by Mr Chan's  grandfather and the company now has more than 70 years' experience importing Thai  rice into Hong Kong.  Kui fat Yuen imports a  number of rice varieties from Thailand, including fragrant long grains such as Thai Hom Mali and Thai Jasmine,  and short grains including white glutinous rice. </p>
                            <h5>THAI HOM MALI RICE:<br>HONG KONG'S CHOICE</h5>
                            <p>However,  of all the varieties, Thai Hom Mali rice is preferred by Chinese communities  for its "softness, aromas and appearance," according to Mr Chan.  "Hong Kong  importers are buying more Thai Hom Mali rice," he adds. "Before it is cooked it  already has a unique smell. After cooking, the aroma that emerges from the rice  cooker is a distinct and very fresh fragrance for us."</p>
                            <p>It's demand is  reflected in its value, and Thai Hom Mali rice cost US$843 for white glutinous rice, US$706 for Thai jasmine rice and US$415 for parboiled rice, according to the Thai Rice  Exporters Association. Aiming to protect its value and freshness, Mr Chan says  his company has fine-tuned its rice import processes over the decades. It is an  exact science and takes two weeks from the documentation, to the shipping from  Thailand, to storage in Hong Kong, and no part of the business is left to  chance. </p>
                            <p>"Once the Thai Hom  Mali rice arrives in Hong Kong, we will immediately unload it in our  warehouse. There is constant temperature of 18 degrees and humidity of 70  degrees to make sure the rice is as fresh as possible and to keep weevils away,"  Mr Chan says.</p>
                            <h5>WHAT MAKES THAI HOM MALI RICE SO POPULAR?</h5>
                            <p>In Hong Kong, Thai Hom Mal i rice is the most popular variety of  any rice globally. According to Hong Kong  government figures, Thai rice had a 52.3% share of all global imports into the city with 25,100 tonnes in February 2019, trailed by Vietnam, Mainland China and Cambodia. Fragrant varieties such as Thai Hom Mali rice account for most of Thai rice imports into Hong Kong at 22,700 tonnes, or 90.4% of total Thai rice imports. "Because Thai Hom Mali rice only has only  one crop a year, it's quite valuable," explains Mr Chan.  </p>
                            <p>The preference for Thai Hom Mali rice amongst Chinese communities has seen it grow in popularity regionally, according to Mr. Chan, facilitated by the large numbers of Chinese people who have migrated to different countries globally. "They promote Thai Hom Mali as the  best rice and no wonder it is getting more popular and the demand is getting  higher and higher," he says.  </p>
                            <div class="subhead">"Once you try Thai Hom Mali rice you will not find another one to compare it with"</div>
                            <p>One of the reasons for its popularity is that Thai Hom Mali rice is a good accompaniment to Chinese dishes and keeps its softness, even after it has gone cold. "In  the Chinese community, when we have a meal we usually have some dishes like  meat, fish and veggies and we order a bowl of rice to complement it," Mr Chan  says. "I think Thai Hom Mali rice is best  suited for these dishes because of its taste, smell, and uniqueness."</p>
                            <p>Global health trends show consumers are eating less carbohydrates such a rice, pasta and bread. But Mr Chan believes this won't have an impact on Thai Hom Mali rice.  "People are more concerned about health and will often choose red or brown rice  to eat but as a whole people still choose to eat Thai Hom Mali rice because of  taste and smell," he said. "Once you try Thai Hom Mali rice you will not find  another one to compare it with."</p>

						<h3>THRIVING ECOSYSTEMS</h3>
						<h1>Reshaping the World with Mobile: The Only Limitation is Our Imagination</h1>
						<p><b>Application-centric, data-driven, intelligent systems</b></p>

						<hr>
							<p>Today faster mobile broadband is delivering services that allow consumers to download high definition video in minutes, play live multiplayer games, watch TV and make video calls on the go without buffering.</p>

							<p>The proliferation of smartphones has connected people across the world and by the middle of this year two thirds of the world’s population have a mobile subscription – a total of 5 billion unique subscribers. By 2020, almost 860 million new subscribers will be added, taking the global penetration rate to 73%.1</p>

							<p>However, with mobile subscriber growth slowing and competition intensifying, many telecom operators are questioning whether they have already had the best of times and the future outlook may not be so promising.</p>

							<p>At this year’s Global Mobile Broadband Forum (MBBF 2017), held in London, the most influential decision makers from the ranks of operators, vendors and other participants in the mobile ecosystem gathered to explore how to achieve sustainable growth into the future.</p>

							<p>In the opening keynote presentation at MBBF 2017, Huawei Rotating CEO Ken Hu, said “What if these operators were told they could tap into 1 billion new subscribers offering sustainable mobile revenues?”</p>

							<p>These new subscribers are modern connected cows, dairy herds that wear mobile connected sensors. In China, operators are helping dairy farmers connect their cows using Huawei’s NB-IoT technology which has battery, cost and coverage advantages. Through the collection of biometric information from the NB-IoT devices, farmers can monitor the cows’ movement and health and let them graze further, to better manage milk production.</p>


							<p>The results are nothing short of impressive – farmer profitability has increased by 50%, equal to $420 per cow, per year, and for the telecom operator every connected cow is a new subscriber, bringing $10 per cow, per year.</p>


							<p>“You could say the connected cow is a cash cow for dairy farmers and operators. And the opportunity doesn’t end there. Connecting ‘things’ such as the world’s 20 million shipping containers, 100 million new bicycles, 300 million LED streetlamps and 1.8 billion water meters, are bringing new services to industries, cities, businesses, and homes, and placing operators at the center of this new mobile world. But driving the connectivity of everything requires fresh thinking, smarter networks and a stronger ecosystem,” said Mr. Hu.</p>

							<h5>New Mindset and Thriving Ecosystem Drive Future Applications</h5>

							<p>For operators to capitalize fully on the opportunity to connect everything demands a new mindset and new business models to be able to scale to the diversity of IoT connections across vertical industries. Operators also need to foster closer relationships with the verticals themselves and the application developers who will enable this environment.</p>


							<p>Huawei is cultivating an ecosystem bringing together global and local, or glocal, business partners to boost industry collaboration and innovation capabilities, and by supporting the greater good of the industry this generates more opportunities for all ecosystem players.</p>


							<p>The impact of this thriving ecosystem can be seen in Huawei’s Wireless X Labs, which is dedicated to the study and exploration of future applications. Since the lab was established last year Huawei has worked with over 250 partners to develop over 45 new innovations including 5G wireless connected smart factories, wireless control of automated vehicles and robotics, and cloud-based industrial cameras. Other examples include connected drones, the world’s first wireless charging base station for drones, cloud-based AI guiding helmets, and remote medical treatment with the low latency of 5G.</p>

							<h5>Smarter Networks from 4.5G to 5G</h5>

							<p>At MBBF 2017, Ryan Ding, president of the Carrier Business Group at Huawei, urged operators to start building capabilities now to support future 5G services.</p>

							<p>In a keynote presentation, Mr. Ding said: “Never leave until tomorrow that which you can do today. Our industry cannot just sit and wait for 5G. We must act now, incubating new services and building new capabilities in 4.5G networks. I believe that WTTx [wireless to the x] and NB-IoT will be a good start.”</p>

							<p>WTTx has become a mainstream way of providing home broadband alongside fiber, copper and cable. The commercial use of WTTx is accelerating globally and by the end of this year there will be over 200 WTTx networks, serving 50 million homes.</p>


							<p>“WTTx is different from the traditional mobile broadband business. There is high data consumption, fixed location and much, much higher concurrency, especially in the night. So we need to build up new capabilities to match this difference,” said Mr. Ding.</p>


							<p>However, existing networks are built for connecting people and they now need to evolve to become application-centric, data-driven, and intelligent systems. The use of big data and AI will enable operators to build networks that can be controlled and managed more intelligently. From operations and maintenance to service provisioning, operators need networks that are automated, self-optimizing, and self-healing to drive stronger performance and greater capacity.</p>


							<p>In the next few years operators will inevitably move to 5G networks which will transform the role of mobile technology in our society. As demand for connected everything grows, 5G will deliver the speed, reliability and security to meet the demands of new applications everywhere. In fact, Huawei is already working with Deutsche Telekom and Orange as well as EE, Telefónica and Vodafone on 5G trials, with EE and Huawei achieving 2.8Gbps in the UK’s first end-to-end 5G test.</p>


							<p>During his keynote speech on embracing 5G mobile networks, Edward Deng, President of Huawei Wireless Solution, highlighted that operators’ top priority is to build a 5G-oriented mobile network that meets the demands of a super connected society and industry development, and this requires fostering three elements of future network:</p>


							<p>“Operators will need powerful network capabilities that meet the high capacity, seamless coverage, and low latency requirements of a wide range of services; an agile network architecture to improve the efficiency of multi-service connections; and intelligent network management to enable efficient network O&M, improve network performance and optimize the service experience,” explained Mr. Deng. To help operators seize new business opportunities and achieve sustainable growth in a digitalized society, Huawei has introduced key technologies and solutions that will power future mobile networks: 5G Era SingleRAN, Mobile Cloud, and Wireless Intelligence.</p>


							<h5>Connecting Everything and Everyone Demands Collaboration</h5>

							<p>In the future mobile broadband will enable fully automated homes, driverless cars, smart manufacturing, smart parking and holographic conference calls among other consumer and industrial applications.</p>

							<p>“However, mobile won’t change the world by itself,” Mr.Hu explained. “There are many challenges to overcome before the promise of truly connected world can be realized. There is a well-known phrase in Chinese – Weiji – which means both challenge and opportunity and translates to through challenge comes opportunity.”</p>

							<p>Adopting this mindset will help drive collaboration among the telecom industry, vertical industry partners and applications developers to enable mobile to deliver a near-endless array of connected services to enhance our lives. “The only limitation will be our imagination,” concluded Mr. Hu.</p>
